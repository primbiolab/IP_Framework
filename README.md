The Inverted Pendulum Control System is a comprehensive, real-time graphical framework designed to bridge the gap between simulation and hardware deployment for complex control tasks. It integrates classical control theory (LQR) with advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques (SAC, DDPG).

Featuring a dynamic, responsive PyQt5 dashboard, the system allows users to interact in real-time—either connecting to physical hardware via serial communication or running the embedded Pygame simulation. The GUI provides live telemetry plotting, dynamic parameter tuning, and integrated reinforcement learning training pipelines.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎛️ Controller Switching:** Switch seamlessly between LQR, SAC, and DDPG controllers in real-time.
- **📈 Real-time Telemetry & Live Plotting:** Visualize state variables (angle, position, velocities, rewards) dynamically using PyQtGraph.
- **🧠 GUI-Integrated RL Training:** Initiate, monitor, and manage the training of SAC and DDPG agents directly from the interface.
- **⚙️ Dynamic Parameter Tuning:** Adjust LQR controller $K$ gains on the fly.
- **💾 CSV Telemetry Export:** Export real-time operational data for offline analysis and research.

## 🚀 GUI Usage Guide

The user interface is designed to be intuitive while exposing powerful control parameters.

1. **Selecting the Controller:** Use the main control panel dropdown to select your active controller (`LQR`, `SAC`, or `DDPG`).
2. **Running the System:**
   - Ensure your Arduino is connected (if using hardware mode) and select the correct COM port from the dropdown.
   - Click the **Start** button to initialize the control loop.
3. **Stopping Execution:** Click the **Stop** or **Emergency Stop** button to safely halt the pendulum and disable motor outputs.
4. **Editing LQR Gains:** When LQR is selected, use the dynamic input fields to adjust the $K$ penalty matrices to observe changes in system stability.
5. **Viewing Telemetry & Plots:** The dashboard displays live numerical telemetry. Switch to the plotting tabs to see scrolling, real-time graphs of the pendulum's angle, cart position, and control efforts.
6. **Training Agents:** Navigate to the RL Training tab, set your hyperparameters (episodes, batch size), and click **Train**. Progress and rewards are logged directly in the UI.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primbiolab/IPFramework.git
cd IPFramework
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the System

To launch the PyQt5 dashboard and start interacting with the system:

```bash
python main_GUI.py
```

## 🔌 Hardware Requirements

To run this system on physical hardware, you need:

- An **Arduino** microcontroller flashed with `inverted_pendulum_arduino.ino`.
- Motor drivers and encoders wired to the specifications expected by the Arduino firmware.
- A stable USB Serial connection to the host PC.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The software is engineered for strict real-time performance using a multi-layered architecture:

- **GUI (PyQt5):** Handles all user interactions, dynamic parameter updates, and live rendering of plots using `pyqtgraph`. It operates on the main thread to remain responsive.
- **Multiprocessing Engine:** To prevent GUI lag from interfering with control execution, the system uses Python's `multiprocessing` module. Control loops and serial communication run in isolated, high-priority processes.
- **Telemetry Queue:** A thread-safe, lock-free queue system transports state vectors and rewards from the control process back to the GUI for visualization and logging.
- **Control Logic:** Modularly designed to allow hot-swapping between the algebraic LQR solver and neural network inference engines (SAC/DDPG).
- **Environment Simulation:** A custom wrapper mimicking the hardware's serial API, allowing seamless transition between simulated Pygame physics and physical actuation.

## 🏋️ Training RL Agents

The framework supports end-to-end training of reinforcement learning models:

- **Training Modes:** Run standalone scripts (`main_sac.py` / `main_ddpg.py`) for headless training, or initiate training directly from the **RL Training** tab in the GUI.
- **Episode Limits:** Each episode automatically resets after 400 steps (approximately 15 seconds).
- **Model Checkpoints:** Policy weights are saved periodically and exported to the `Models_agents/` directory, making them immediately selectable in the GUI.

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Serial Port Issues:** If the system fails to connect to the hardware, verify the correct COM port is selected in the GUI and ensure the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor is closed.
- **Missing Models:** If you receive an error when selecting SAC or DDPG in the GUI, ensure the pre-trained weights are correctly located in the `Models_agents/` subdirectories.

## 🎓 Credits & Academic Context

This framework was developed at the **Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Sede de La Paz)** within the **hotbed PRIMBIO** research group. 

It serves as a comprehensive academic and research tool to evaluate, compare, and demonstrate the efficacy of classical control (LQR) versus modern, data-driven optimization strategies (SAC/DDPG) in highly unstable, non-linear environments.
